# The Machine Learning Companion Scripts
An additional script created by MathWorks specifically for MATLAB Online users is included with each exercise. These companion scripts are designed to be used after completing the programming exercise. They will show you how to use the MATLAB machine learning functions and apps used by researchers and professionals to perform the tasks in the exercise. You'll also be introduced to the latest tools, features, and datatypes essential to data analysis in MATLAB that weren't available when Machine Learning was created. 
What do the companion scripts cover?  

  ex1_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions and apps from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to quickly create and train linear and polynomial regression models.
  
  ex2_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions and apps from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to implement logistic regression.  
  
  ex3_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to easily create and train multi-class classification models. Explore an existing neural network created using the Deep Learning Toolbox, then use it to classify digit images.  
  
  ex4_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions and apps from the Deep Learning Toolbox to create and train a custom neural network.  
  
  ex5_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions and apps from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to quickly partition data and automatically cross-validate machine learning models to determine optimal hyperparameter settings.  
  
  ex6_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions and apps from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to create, train, and cross-validate support vector machine classifiers.  
ex7_MATLAB.mlx: Use functions from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to cluster data and determine the optimal number of clusters. Then learn how to compress data using PCA and automatically include data compression when using the MATLAB machine learning apps.  
ex8_MATLAB1.mlx: Use functions and apps from the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox to create and evaluate statistical models for classification.  
ex8_MATLAB2.mlx: Use MATLAB functionality for working with big data to analyze movie ratings data and implement recommender systems using sparse arrays.   

## How to use the companion scripts
Complete a programming exercise.  
Open the corresponding companion script.  
Follow the instructions which will guide you through the use of MATLAB functions, tools and apps. No additional coding is required!  
Questions, Comments, and Issues with the Companion Scripts. 
The companion scripts are a new feature designed for MATLAB Online users only. They are not part of the original course materials. If you experience issues with the companion scripts including errors, bugs, or typos, or if you would like to provide additional feedback or seek additional information about the MATLAB features used, please post in the 'MATLAB Help' discussion forum.  
Open the corresponding companion script.
